# Chess Game! 

<h3> Description </h3>
This projects allows for two players to play the classical game of chess. The game will initially be played using the console, where each player will input their move using the classical chess [notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)).

<h3> Plans for the Project </h3>
The initial goal is to play the game through the console. Afterwards, I will implement a website that will host the game's logic. Players would be able to send the website's link to invite another player.
